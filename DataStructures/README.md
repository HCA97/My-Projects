# Basic Data Structures

#### Data Sturctures that I implemented for my Algorithms and Data Structures Class are;

- Immutable List
- Mutable List
- Basic Iterator
- Stack with Immutable List
- Queue with Immutable List
- Linked List with Mutable List
- Doubly Linked List with Mutable List
- List Set with Immutable List
- Bit Vector
- Buffer

There are examples in test files that can help you to understand the code.
